Task: Add Runtime Safety Checks
Summary: Added validation for the Mapillary access token in 'MapillaryView.vue' to prevent initialization if the token is missing or invalid. Added console logging to the 'mounted' hook of 'StreetView.vue' to track the loading process of mapping APIs and areas.
Files: src/components/MapillaryView.vue, src/pages/StreetView.vue
Why: To prevent runtime crashes and provide better visibility into the application's startup lifecycle, making it easier to diagnose blank page issues.
