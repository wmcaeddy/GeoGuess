Task: Handle Navigation Events
Summary: Implemented an event listener for Mapillary's 'image' event to capture location changes. The component now emits a custom 'moved' event with the new lat/lng coordinates. Added unit tests to verify event emission.
Files: src/components/MapillaryView.vue, tests/unit/components/MapillaryView.spec.js
Why: To allow the parent game component to track the player's movement within the Mapillary street-level imagery.
